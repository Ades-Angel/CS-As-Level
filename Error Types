Syntax errors - 
This type of bug comes from typos. 
When the python interpreter sees a syntax error, 
it's becasuse the code isn't written in proper Python Language.
A pyhton program with a single syntax error won't run.

Runtime errors - 
These are bugs that happen while the program us running. 
The program will work until it reaches the line of code with the error, 
and then the program will crash. The Python interpreter will display a 
traceback.

Sematic errors - 
These bugs (which are the trickiest to fix) don't crash the program, 
but they do not do the indented job given.

Crash - program terminates with an error message.

Traceback - an erro message showing the line containing the problem.
